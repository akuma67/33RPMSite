I made this site as a little thing to have for the record label I run, hopefully you like it.

Google - Used some fonts from Google Fonts (Roboto and Open Sans, I know they're not amazing but they work)

Jack, Blake, and Tom - Thanks for helping me out with the CSS on this site, I guess

*Don't expect this project to be huge.*

I'm mainly just throwing this out there so people can see what I'm capable of.
